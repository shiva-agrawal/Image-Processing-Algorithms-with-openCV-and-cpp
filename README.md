# Image Processing with openCV,  C++ and Ubuntu 16.04

The aim of this project is to collect and provide basic image processing functionalities of OpenCV library. Here, various image processing functions are available and categorized. 

Each category of the functions is written as separate .cpp file. Inside each .cpp file, further each functionality is written as preprocessor #ifdef â€¦ #endif block which user can activate and deactivate as per requirement. Within each block of code, the respective function is well explained and tested using images.

For the development, I have used Eclipse CDT as IDE, OpenCV, C++ programming language and Ubuntu 16.04 (Linux OS).
